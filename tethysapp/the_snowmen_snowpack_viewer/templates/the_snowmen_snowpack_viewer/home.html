    <p>This is part of the course 514-Geospatial software development at Brigham Young University.</p>
    <p>Here you will find the written <b><a href="/apps/the-snowmen-snowpack-viewer/proposal">proposal</a></b> for the Snow Pack Project.</p>
    <p>Also you will see the planned <b><a href="/apps/the-snowmen-snowpack-viewer/mockup">Mock Up</a></b> for the Snow Pack Project.</p>
    <p><b><a href="/apps/the-snowmen-snowpack-viewer/data_services">Data Services</a></b> talks about the data services used in our Geoprocessing tools, how the data were created, where are the data hosting, and what data is included</p>
    <p>The <b><a href="/apps/the-snowmen-snowpack-viewer/animation">Animation Tool</a></b> allows the user to view the each of the rasters for January 2017 and view an animation file video file which plays the rasters through the month of January.  The <b><a href="/apps/the-snowmen-snowpack-viewer/polygontool">Polygon Tool</a></b> allows the user to draw a polygon around any region in utah(a ski resort for example) and creates a new result file with contours based on the data from that region.  The <b><a href="/apps/the-snowmen-snowpack-viewer/watershedtool">Watershed Tool</a></b> does this for a watershed that is specified by a user defined point(outfall).  Each of these three map pages(<b><a href="/apps/the-snowmen-snowpack-viewer/animation">Animation</a></b>, <b><a href="/apps/the-snowmen-snowpack-viewer/polygontool">Polygon</a></b>, and <b><a href="/apps/the-snowmen-snowpack-viewer/mockup">Watershed</a></b>) also allows the user to view time series data for each of the snotel stations in the state of Utah.</p>
    <p>The <b><a href="/apps/the-snowmen-snowpack-viewer/about">about</a></b> page include a little bit about who the authors are and the links to contact them.</p>

             <br>The <b><a href="/apps/the-snowmen-snowpack-viewer/polygontool">Polygon Tool</a></b> allows the user to perform a regional analysis for snow depth on a specific area in Utah (a ski resort for example).<br>
             <br>The <b><a href="/apps/the-snowmen-snowpack-viewer/watershedtool">Watershed Tool</a></b> performs a snow depth analysis for a watershed that calculated from a user defined outlet point.
